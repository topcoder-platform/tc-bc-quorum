# Topcoder - PoC Challenge Review Process with Blockchain - API Setup

This is the validation document for PoC Challenge Review Process with Blockchain - API - Setup


## Postman Verification

Import Postman collection `docs/postman.json` with environment variables `docs/postman-env.json`.

**NOTE**: Because a project is copied to 'topcoder-review' channel only after its status is 'active'.
So after you created a project, please update its status to 'active' before testing the create challenge/register apis.
